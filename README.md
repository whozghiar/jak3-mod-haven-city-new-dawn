> scoped to this branch — GitHub renders it live from that workflow's own run history,
> nothing generates or rewrites this image by hand. It goes green the moment this branch
> next merges `master-dev` cleanly (usually via the daily automated sync), and can turn
> red if someone pushes commits here without syncing first. It cannot turn red purely
> because `master-dev` moved on without a new push landing here — run `task modding-branch-status`
> or check GitHub Actions to audit fleet-wide mergeability.

## Developer Setup & Local Compilation

If you want to modify or compile this mod locally from source:

### 1. Select the Active Game
Make sure your environment is targeting Jak 3:
```bash
task set-game-jak3
```

### 2. Binary Compilation
- **Status:** [Not required (GOAL-only mod, standard binaries sufficient) / `task build-release-game` (engine or compiler C++ changed) / `task build-release` + `task extract` (decompiler or decompiler/config changed)]
- **Details:** [Specify which C++ layer was modified — see `docs/modding/guides/build_and_iteration_workflow.md`]
```bash
# GOAL-only mod: nothing to build — go straight to the REPL below.
# Engine / compiler C++ changed:
task build-release-game
# Decompiler or decompiler/config changed (then step 3 is mandatory):
task build-release-decomp
```

### 3. Asset Extraction
- **Status:** [Required (`task extract`) / Standard extraction sufficient]
- **Details:** [Specify if custom 3D models, textures, or sound banks require extraction]
```bash
task extract
```

### 4. Launch the Game
Run the game natively:
```bash
task boot-game
```
*(Or launch via the OpenGOAL REPL using `task repl`, then compile and run with `(mi)` and `(r)`).*

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] **Native non-regression:** with the mod compiled but its toggle OFF, the game plays identically to stock.
- [ ] **In-game Mods toggle [MANDATORY FOR FEATURES]:** the mod registers at least one enable/disable entry via `(mods-menu-register "jak2_haven_city" ...)` (Jak 2 / Jak 3, opens with **L3 + SELECT**, works in a retail boot) or a `jak2_haven_city`-prefixed **debug-only** submenu (Jak 1). See [`docs/modding/guides/mods_menu.md`](docs/modding/guides/mods_menu.md).
- [ ] **No direct `default-menu*.gc` edits.**
- [ ] **Symbols prefixed** with the mod slug (`*mod-jak2_haven_city-*`, `mod-jak2_haven_city-*`).
- [ ] **Verified Lisp instructions** used by this mod are present in `docs/modding/lisp_instructions.md` (landed on `master-dev` via `task modding-land-doc`).
- [ ] **In-code comments** on every new/overridden type, method, state, macro.
- [ ] **Mod cover thumbnail:** Optional cover image deposited at `docs/img/mod/mod_cover.png` for OpenGOAL Launcher display.
