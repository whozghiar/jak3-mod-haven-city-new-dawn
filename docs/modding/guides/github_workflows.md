# GitHub Actions Workflows Guide

What each workflow in `.github/workflows/` does, when it runs and who may run it. It covers
`<owner>/jak-project` (the mother repository, the original or a fork of it) and the mod
repositories created from its `master-dev`, which inherit the same files. The day-to-day workflow around them is in
[`repository_workflow.md`](repository_workflow.md).

## 1. Architecture

```text
[open-goal/jak-project] master
        |  daily at 10:00 UTC: sync-upstream.yaml
        v
[<owner>/jak-project] master        clean upstream mirror
        |  merged by sync-upstream.yaml
        v
[<owner>/jak-project] master-dev    modding base: engine patches, tooling, Mods menu
        |
        +--> mod repositories, <owner>/<game>-mod-<slug>  (task modding-new-mod)
        |       on demand: task modding-sync-branch -- --push, or task modding-sync-all
        |       on push: lint.yml; by hand: build.yml, release.yml
        |
        +--> old mod branches jak[1-3]/<type>/<slug>: archived as tags archive/<branch>;
                a restored branch gets sync-branch-with-master-dev.yml and
                branch-sync-check.yaml

GitHub Releases of any of these repositories
        --> sync-global-catalog.yml --> index.json on master-dev (one launcher URL for every mod)
```

Nothing merges into a mod automatically: `sync-upstream.yaml` stops at `master-dev`, and a mod
picks up `master-dev` only when someone syncs it.

## 2. Access control

Workflows that push, publish or spend real CI time start with an explicit actor check (an
`authorize` job, or an early step) instead of relying only on GitHub's write-access rule:

- **Repository owner only:** `sync-upstream.yaml`, `sync-branch-with-master-dev.yml`, `build.yml`, `release.yml`.
- **Owner, or `release.yml`'s own automation** (`github-actions[bot]`): `sync-global-catalog.yml`, which `release.yml` dispatches with `gh workflow run`.

An unauthorized run fails at once with an `::error::` naming who triggered it.

Open by design:

- `mod-suggestion-triage.yml` reacts to issues opened by players. Its blast radius is narrow:
  `issues: write` only, and the issue text is read inside `actions/github-script`, never
  interpolated into YAML, which avoids script injection.
- `branch-sync-check.yaml` and `lint.yml` run on `push`, which already requires write access,
  and are read-only (`contents: read`).

**Mother repository guard.** A mod repository inherits every workflow file. The jobs that only
make sense in the mother repository — `sync-upstream.yaml`, `sync-global-catalog.yml`,
`mod-suggestion-triage.yml`, `branch-sync-check.yaml`, `sync-branch-with-master-dev.yml`, and
`release.yml`'s "Trigger Downstream Syncs" step — carry
`if: endsWith(github.repository, '/jak-project')`: they run in the mother repository and in any
fork of it that keeps the name, never in a mod repository. A mod repository also drops those files when it
syncs, and keeps only `release.yml`, `lint.yml` and `build.yml`
(`scripts/modding/sync_common.ALLOWED_MOD_REPO_WORKFLOWS`).

## 3. Upstream sync (`sync-upstream.yaml`)

- **Runs:** daily at 10:00 UTC, or by hand (owner only).
- **Does:** fast-forwards `master` from `open-goal/jak-project`, then merges `master` into
  `master-dev`.
- **Keeps the fork's own CI:** upstream's workflows and issue templates are pruned during the
  merge. Only the workflows in its `allowed_workflows` list and the `mod-bug-report.yml`,
  `mod-suggestion.yml` and `config.yml` issue templates stay.
- **Stops on a real code conflict:** the merge is aborted with a warning; `master-dev` is left
  untouched until someone merges by hand.
- Pushing upstream workflow updates to `master` needs a `GH_PAT` secret with `repo` and
  `workflow` scopes; without it that push fails with a warning.

## 4. Mod branch sync (`sync-branch-with-master-dev.yml`)

For a mod branch of this repository. The old ones are archived as tags `archive/<branch>`; this
workflow serves a branch restored from one.

- **Runs:** by hand only, owner only. Pick the branch with "Use workflow from".
- **Does:** `python scripts/modding/sync_branch_with_master_dev.py --push`: merges
  `origin/master-dev` into the branch with the rules of `scripts/modding/sync_common.py` (the
  mod's README and `index.json` stay the mod's, shared docs and agent configuration come from
  `master-dev`), then pushes. Merge only, never rebase: a rebase would force-push published
  history with nobody reviewing it.
- Refuses to run on `master` or `master-dev`.

A mod repository syncs locally instead: `task modding-sync-branch -- --push` on `mods/<name>`.

## 5. Mod branch health check (`branch-sync-check.yaml`)

- **Runs:** on every push to `jak[1-3]/**`, or by hand.
- **Does:** checks `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/master-dev HEAD`, which drives the GitHub
  status badge of a mod branch's README. A push of commits made without syncing first turns it
  red; the fix is `task modding-sync-branch`.
- **Caveat:** it only re-runs on a push, so the badge does not turn red just because
  `master-dev` moved on.

## 6. Source lint (`lint.yml`)

- **Runs:** on every push, on every branch and repository, or by hand.
- **Does:** checks that finish in seconds and need no build:
  `scripts/ci/lint-trailing-whitespace.py` (no trailing whitespace in `goal_src`),
  `scripts/ci/check-for-asserts.py` (no raw `assert()` in the C++ engine),
  `scripts/ci/lint-autoglottonyms.py` and `scripts/ci/lint-characters.py` (translation files),
  and `scripts/ci/lint-gsrc-removals.py` (fails if a diff against `origin/master` removes a line
  tagged `og:preserve-this` from `goal_src`).
- Read-only: it reports, it never fixes or commits.

## 7. Build check (`build.yml`)

- **Runs:** by hand only, owner only, from any branch or mod repository.
- **Does:** compiles `gk`, `goalc` and `extractor` for Windows (Clang-CL, static) and Linux
  (Clang, static), the same targets as `release.yml`, and uploads the binaries as 3-day build
  artifacts. No packaging, no release.
- **Manual on purpose:** a Release build of both platforms takes 30 to 60 minutes. Locally,
  `task compile-check` verifies the GOAL code in about a minute.

## 8. Release (`release.yml`)

- **Runs:** by hand only, owner only, from a mod repository (or a mod branch), with the inputs
  `mod_name`, `mod_description`, `tag_name` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) and `prerelease`.
- **Does:**
  - builds Windows and Linux binaries from clean source with static libraries, so players need
    no redistributable;
  - packages `gk`, `goalc`, `extractor` and `data/`, plus any texture pack found in
    `docs/modding/current_mod/texture_packs/`;
  - writes `SHA256SUMS.txt`, updates the mod's own `index.json` and commits it back;
  - tags the release `<slug>-vX.Y.Z`. In a mod repository, the slug and game come from its
    `index.json` (else from its `<game>-mod-<slug>` name), so the launcher keeps the same catalog key.
- **Downstream sync (mother repository only):** `gh workflow run sync-global-catalog.yml`. A
  release published with `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot fire another workflow's `on: release` trigger, so
  this explicit call is what refreshes the catalog; it needs `actions: write`. Releases of mod
  repositories reach the catalog through its daily schedule.
- **Permissions:** `contents: read` by default; only the `publish` job gets `contents: write` and
  `actions: write`.

## 9. Mod suggestion triage (`mod-suggestion-triage.yml`)

- **Runs:** when an issue made with the "Mod Suggestion" form (`mod-suggestion.yml`) is opened
  or edited. Mother repository only: suggestions for new mods are filed here.
- **Does:** labels the suggestion by game (`jak1`, `jak2`, `jak3`, `jakx`), category
  (`type:gameplay`, `type:entities`, `type:textures`, `type:audio`, `type:levels`, `type:qol`)
  and status (`enhancement`, `mod-suggestion`, `needs-triage`).

Bug reports go to each mod's own repository, through the generic `mod-bug-report.yml` form it
inherits.

## 10. Global catalog (`sync-global-catalog.yml`)

- **Runs:** when a release of this repository is published, edited or deleted by hand; when
  `release.yml` dispatches it; daily at 10:30 UTC; or by hand. Owner or `release.yml`'s
  automation only.
- **Does:** runs `scripts/modding/sync_global_catalog.py` on `master-dev`:
  1. fetches the releases of this repository and of every mod repository (same owner,
     `opengoal-mod` topic);
  2. reads the catalog attached to each release and dedupes versions;
  3. takes each mod repository's own `index.json` as the source of its name, description and
     website;
  4. writes the root `index.json` in the OpenGOAL Launcher mod-source v1 schema and pushes it to
     `master-dev`.
- **Why:** players add one URL to the launcher,
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/jak-project/master-dev/index.json`, and get every
  published mod and texture pack.
