# How the Repository Works

How the mother repository, the mod repositories and the knowledge base fit together, how each
mod gets its own folder (a git worktree) in one clone, and the commands for day-to-day work.
For CI triggers and permissions see [`github_workflows.md`](github_workflows.md); for every task
option see [`task_scripts_reference.md`](task_scripts_reference.md); to start a mod from scratch
see [`how_to_create_a_mod.md`](how_to_create_a_mod.md).

`<owner>` below is the GitHub account that holds the mother repository: the original project's,
or yours in a fork (see [section 7](#7-working-from-a-fork)).

## 1. Three kinds of repositories

| Repository | Holds | Default branch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<owner>/jak-project`, the mother | `master`: a mirror of `open-goal/jak-project`, synced daily. `master-dev`: the modding base every mod starts from (engine and compiler patches, the Mods menu framework, scripts, `Taskfile.yml`, CI, `AGENTS.md`, templates, and the global launcher catalog `index.json`). | `master-dev` |
| `<owner>/<game>-mod-<slug>`, one per mod | The mod: `master-dev` plus the mod's own changes, its README, releases and issues. `<slug>` is the mod's launcher catalog key, kept verbatim. Tagged with the `opengoal-mod` topic. | `main` |
| `opengoal-modding-kb`, the knowledge base | Agent skills and the verified Lisp wiki, mounted as the `.agents/skills` submodule in the mother and in every mod repository. Its URL is in `.gitmodules`. | `main` |

```text
open-goal/jak-project --daily--> jak-project master --> jak-project master-dev --+--> jak2-mod-a (main)
                                                                                 +--> jak2-mod-b (main)
                                                                                 +--> ... one repository per mod

opengoal-modding-kb (main) --submodule .agents/skills--> every repository above
```

## 2. One clone, one folder per mod

A mod repository shares its history with the mother, so one clone of `jak-project` holds every
mod, the way it held mod branches:

| Branch in the clone | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| `master-dev` | The modding base. |
| `mods/<name>` | The `main` branch of the mod repository `<name>`, which is a remote of the clone. `git push` on it goes to that repository's `main`. |
| `archive/jak[1-3]/<type>/<slug>` (tags) | The old mod branches, archived: those of the moved mods, and the mods not moved yet. See [Archived branches](#archived-branches). |

### One worktree per mod

Each mod gets its own folder, a git worktree of the clone, and the main folder stays on
`master-dev`. Changing mods means opening another folder: each one keeps its C++ build and its
selected game, while the game data is shared between all of them. One copy of the extracted and
compiled game exists at a time, so switching to a mod means extracting and compiling it again
(see [Switch to another mod](#switch-to-another-mod)).

```text
jak-project/                                  master-dev; holds the game data
└── .worktrees/                               ignored by git
    └── <name>.jak-project/                   mods/<name>
        ├── iso_data/        -> jak-project/iso_data/        (junction)
        ├── decompiler_out/  -> jak-project/decompiler_out/  (junction)
        └── out/
            ├── build/                        its own C++ build
            ├── jak1/, jak2/, jak3/  -> jak-project/out/jak1/, ...  (junctions)
            └── textures/        -> jak-project/out/textures/    (junction)
```

Open a mod with **File ▸ Open Folder** on `.worktrees/<name>.jak-project`, or
`code .worktrees/<name>.jak-project`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The folder name must end in `jak-project`. `gk`, `goalc` and the decompiler find the project
> from the last `jak-project` in the path of their own executable
> (`try_get_project_path_from_path` in `common/util/FileUtil.cpp`). Under any other name,
> `jak-project-<name>` included, they run on the main folder's `goal_src/` and `out/`.

What the worktrees share:

| Folder | Depends on the mod? | In a worktree |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `iso_data/` | No: the game files, never written. | A junction to the main folder's. |
| `decompiler_out/` | No: what the decompiler extracts from the ISO. A mod's texture replacements and extra art groups are written to `out/<game>/fr3/`, not here. | A junction to the main folder's. |
| `out/build/` | Yes: seven mods change C++ (the actor builder, the overlord, the decompiler), and the build compiles the sources of the folder that configured it. About 450 MB. | Its own. |
| `out/<game>/`, `out/textures/` | Yes: the compiled game, the built CGO/DGO files and the `.fr3` level graphics. About 6 GB for Jak 2. | A junction to the main folder's, holding the last mod extracted and compiled. |
| `.claude/skills/`, the selected game | Per folder. | Its own. |

#### Add a mod's worktree

From the main folder, in PowerShell, with `<name>` taken from `task modding-switch -- --list`
(a mod that is not in the clone yet: `task modding-switch -- <name>`, then
`task modding-switch -- master-dev`, fetches it):

```powershell
git worktree add .worktrees/<name>.jak-project mods/<name>
$wt = ".worktrees\<name>.jak-project"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$wt\iso_data"    # the checkout's copy: only the per-game .gitignore files
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$wt\iso_data" -Target "$PWD\iso_data"
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$wt\decompiler_out" -Target "$PWD\decompiler_out"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$wt\out"
foreach ($d in "jak1", "jak2", "jak3", "textures") {
  New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$wt\out\$d" -Target "$PWD\out\$d"
}
```

Then, once, in the new folder, build its C++ (about 7 minutes for `gk` and `goalc`, seconds for
the decompiler after them):

```bash
task kb-update && task ai-link && task set-game-<game>
task gen-cmake-release
task build-release-game
task build-release-decomp
```

#### Switch to another mod

Open its folder, then extract and compile it (under 3 minutes for a Jak 2 mod). There is no C++
to rebuild: the worktree keeps its own `out/build/`, built once, until the mod's C++ changes.

```bash
task extract                 # the mod's level graphics into out/<game>/fr3
```

Then force the compile, in the REPL (`task repl`):

```lisp
(make-group "iso" :force #t)
```

or headless: `out/build/Release/bin/goalc --user-auto --game <game> --cmd '(make-group "iso" :force #t)'`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `(mi)` is `(make-group "iso")` without `:force`, and that is not enough after a switch.
> Without `:force`, `goalc` recompiles a file only when its source is newer than its output
> (`Tool::needs_run` in `goalc/make/Tool.cpp`). A worktree's sources date from its checkout,
> older than what the previous mod compiled into the shared `out/<game>/`, so `(mi)` and
> `task compile-check` would keep the previous mod's compiled files. `:force #t` recompiles
> everything. The same holds for the main folder when you come back to `master-dev`. Once the
> mod is compiled, `(mi)` is right again for the edits that follow, since an edited file is newer
> than its output.

#### Remove a mod's worktree

> [!CAUTION]
> Git sees a junction as a plain folder. `git worktree remove`, VS Code's **Delete Worktree** or
> `git clean -x` would delete the shared `iso_data/`, `decompiler_out/` and `out/` game folders
> through it. Remove the junctions first with `rmdir`, which deletes only the link (PowerShell
> 5.1's `Remove-Item -Recurse` on a junction empties its target).

```powershell
$wt = ".worktrees\<name>.jak-project"
foreach ($d in "iso_data", "decompiler_out", "out\jak1", "out\jak2", "out\jak3", "out\textures") {
  cmd /c rmdir "$wt\$d"
}
git worktree remove .worktrees/<name>.jak-project     # the branch mods/<name> stays
```

#### Day to day

| To | Do |
| :--- | :--- |
| Work on a mod | Open its folder and, coming from another mod, [switch](#switch-to-another-mod) first; then edit, `task compile-check`, commit, `git push` (it goes to the mod repository). |
| Bring `master-dev` into a mod | `task modding-sync-branch -- --push` in its folder. |
| Bring it into every mod | `task modding-sync-all` from the main folder: it merges in each mod's worktree, which must have no uncommitted changes. |
| Rebuild after the mod's C++ changed (`game/`, `goalc/`, `common/`) | `task build-release-game` in its folder. |
| Re-extract after its texture replacements or decompiler config changed | `task extract` in its folder. |

### Switching one folder

Without worktrees, one folder switches between mods:

```bash
task modding-switch -- --list                     # the mod repositories
task modding-switch -- jak2-mod-my-mod            # a mod repository, fetched on first use
task modding-switch -- master-dev                 # back to the modding base
```

Use `task modding-switch` rather than a bare `git switch`: on `master-dev` and in mod
repositories `.agents/skills` is the knowledge-base submodule, while an old mod branch restored
from its archive carries a plain copy of the skills at the same path, and git refuses to put one
in place of the other. The task parks the submodule first (after checking it holds no unpushed
knowledge-base work) and refreshes the knowledge base and the skill links after switching. Old
branches predate the task: to leave one, run `git switch master-dev` (or
`git switch mods/<name>`), then `task kb-update`. A mod that has a worktree cannot be switched
to: git checks a branch out in one folder only, so open its worktree instead.

#### From the IDE

In VS Code, and in editors built on it, select the branch name in the status bar (or run
**Git: Checkout to** from the Command Palette) and pick `mods/<name>`, for example
`mods/jak2-mod-peaceful-haven-city`, or `master-dev`. Between those branches this does the same
as the task, except two things: it does not fetch a mod repository that is not in the clone yet
(run `task modding-switch -- <name>` once for it), and it leaves the knowledge base as it was
(run `task kb-update`, or let the next Claude Code session do it). Uncommitted changes follow
you, or VS Code offers to stash them: commit before switching mods.

#### What a switch changes

A switch replaces the tracked files (game code, engine, scripts, `Taskfile.yml`, docs, agent
configuration) with the target's. Everything git ignores stays as it was: `iso_data/`,
`decompiler_out/`, `out/` (the C++ build and the compiled game), the sccache cache, and the game
selected with `task set-game-*`. The build outputs are the previous mod's until you rebuild what
differs:

| The two mods differ in | Run after the switch |
| :--- | :--- |
| Game code (`goal_src/`) | `task compile-check`, or `(mi)` in the REPL: changed files recompile. |
| C++ (`game/`, `goalc/`, `common/`) | `task build-release-game`; sccache, when installed, serves the objects it compiled before. |
| The decompiler (`decompiler/`, `decompiler/config/`) | `task build-release-decomp`, then `task extract`. |
| Texture replacements (`custom_assets/<game>/texture_replacements/`) | `task extract`: textures are baked at extraction. |
| The game | `task set-game-jak1`, `-jak2` or `-jak3`. |

### Limits

| Limit | Why | What to do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Saves and settings are shared | `%APPDATA%/OpenGOAL/<game>/` holds the saves (a cold boot loads slot 1) and `pc-settings.gc` for every mod and for the stock game, whatever the folder. | Before testing a mod, think about what the previous one saved: start a new game, or move the save files aside. |
| A clean tree | `task modding-switch` refuses to switch over uncommitted changes or untracked files, and `task modding-sync-all` skips a worktree that has some. | Commit, or stash with a message and apply it when you come back. |
| One agent memory per folder | Claude Code keeps its auto memory per folder: each worktree has its own, while the mods switched in one folder share one. | Keep a mod's notes in its `docs/modding/current_mod/`, and verified general facts in the knowledge base. |
| The knowledge base moves on its own | Each repository pins a knowledge-base commit, and the session hook fast-forwards `.agents/skills` to the latest, so `git status` can show `.agents/skills` as modified. | Commit it with your next change, or leave it: the next sync with `master-dev` brings the base's pointer. |

## 3. Everyday tasks

### Start a new mod

```bash
task modding-new-mod     # from the main folder, on master-dev
```

The task asks for the game, the mod name (it names the repository `<game>-mod-<name>`), one sentence
for players and the visibility, then creates the repository from `master-dev` with a README from
[`MOD_README.template.md`](../templates/MOD_README.template.md), the `opengoal-mod` topic, and the
local branch `mods/<game>-mod-<name>`; give it a folder with
[Add a mod's worktree](#add-a-mods-worktree). The whole procedure, through to the release, is in
[`how_to_create_a_mod.md`](how_to_create_a_mod.md).

### Work on a mod

In the mod's folder (or on `mods/<name>` after a switch): edit, verify with
`task compile-check`, ask for a cold boot
(`task boot-game-retail` checks the Mods menu), commit, then `git push`. The golden rules are in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md): runtime toggle, native non-regression, comments, change log
(in the mod's technical README, not in its player README).

`git push` on `mods/<name>` goes to that repository's `main`: the branch tracks `<name>/main`,
and the remote `<name>` carries the push rule `refs/heads/mods/<name>:refs/heads/main`. VS
Code's Push and Sync buttons follow the same tracking. Only a typed `git push origin` would go
elsewhere, creating a `mods/<name>` branch in the mother repository: the pre-push hook that
`task git-hooks` installs refuses it.

### Bring the latest modding base into the current mod

```bash
task modding-sync-branch -- --push
```

On `mods/<name>` this merges `origin/master-dev` under the mod-repository rules and pushes to the
mod repository:

| Path | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| `README.md`, `index.json` | Always the mod's. |
| `docs/modding/current_mod/` | The mod's version wins a conflict. |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.agents/` (the knowledge-base pointer), `scripts/ai/`, the other `docs/modding/` files, issue templates | `master-dev`'s version wins a conflict. |
| Workflows | `release.yml`, `lint.yml` and `build.yml` only; the mother-only ones are removed. |
| `master-dev`-only files (`.github/dependabot.yml`, the mod-suggestion issue form) | Removed. |
| Everything else, game code included | A normal merge. A real conflict stops the sync for you to resolve. |

In a clone of the mod repository alone, the same task adds a `mother` remote pointing at
`<owner>/jak-project` on first use and merges its `master-dev`.

### Bring it into every mod at once

```bash
task modding-sync-all -- --dry-run   # what would happen
task modding-sync-all                # do it
task modding-sync-all -- jak2-mod-a jak2-mod-b   # only these
```

For each mod repository (the `mods/*` branches, plus the `opengoal-mod` repositories of the
account when `gh` is installed), the task fetches it, merges `origin/master-dev` with the same
rules in the mod's own worktree when it has one, otherwise in a temporary worktree outside your
working directory, and pushes the result to its `main`. It never touches the folder you run it
from. It skips a mod that is already up to date, one whose `mods/<name>` has commits you have not
pushed (push them first), one whose worktree has uncommitted changes, and the one checked out in
the folder you run it from (sync that one with `task modding-sync-branch -- --push`). A mod
that hits a real conflict is left as it was, nothing pushed, and the summary says which files to
resolve by hand.

Nothing syncs a mod on its own: a released mod can stay on the base it was built with until it
needs something newer.

### Change the modding base

Engine and compiler patches, the Mods menu framework, tooling and shared docs are committed on
`master-dev` and pushed; the mods pick them up at their next sync. Reusable code first written in
a mod goes to `master-dev` with `git cherry-pick`, since the repositories share their history.

### Release a mod

Run `release.yml` from the mod repository: the steps are in
[`how_to_create_a_mod.md`](how_to_create_a_mod.md#9-release), the pipeline and the inputs in
[`mod_distribution_guide.md`](mod_distribution_guide.md). The release is tagged
`<slug>-vX.Y.Z`, and the global catalog on `master-dev` lists it within a day: the catalog reads
only the most advanced release of each mod repository. Releases published in `jak-project` before
a mod moved to its repository stay there, but the catalog no longer lists them.

### Record a discovery

Verified knowledge that would help another mod goes into the knowledge base, never into a mod
repository or a memory file. Follow the `kb` skill: find the topic, edit its entry in place, cite
the evidence, then commit and push from `.agents/skills`. Every repository picks it up at its
next Claude Code session, or with `task kb-update`.

### Move an archived mod into its own repository

```bash
task modding-new-mod -- --from-branch jak2/features/<slug>
```

It works from the branch or from its archive tag. Add `--prepare-only` to build and inspect
`mods/<game>-mod-<slug>` before publishing it. A mod that was never released gets no
`index.json`: its first release creates it.

### Private repositories

Answer `private` when `task modding-new-mod` asks for the visibility, or pass `--private`. To
change an existing repository, use its GitHub settings (Danger Zone, Change visibility) or:

```bash
gh repo edit <owner>/<name> --visibility private --accept-visibility-change-consequences
```

| | Public | Private |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Your work in this clone (`task modding-switch`, `git push`, `task modding-sync-all`) | Same | Same |
| Who sees the code, issues and releases | Everyone | You and the collaborators you invite |
| New releases in the launcher | Listed by the global catalog | Not listed: players cannot download them |
| GitHub Actions minutes (lint on each push, releases) | Free | Taken from the account's monthly free minutes; Windows runners count double |

Making a private mod public is the same command with `--visibility public`; the catalog lists its
latest release at its next daily run. The mother repository stays public: it is a fork of a public
repository.

### List every mod repository

Every mod repository carries the `opengoal-mod` topic:

```bash
gh repo list <owner> --topic opengoal-mod
```

On GitHub, search `user:<owner> topic:opengoal-mod`.

### Why the mod repositories are not GitHub forks

A GitHub account holds at most one repository per fork network ("you can only have one fork in a
repository's network of forks", GitHub support), and `<owner>/jak-project` is already the
account's fork of `open-goal/jak-project`. The mod repositories are therefore created by push.
They share the mother's history the way forks do, so `git merge` syncs them the same way, and
`task modding-sync-all` stands in for GitHub's Sync fork button. What a fork would add is the
"forked from" link and pull requests between the mother and a mod on GitHub's web interface.

### Archived branches

The mother repository keeps only `master` and `master-dev`. Every old mod branch is archived as
the tag `archive/<branch>`, at the commit the branch pointed to, so nothing is lost and the
branch list stays short. Releases made from those branches stay: they belong to their own tags.

```bash
git tag --list "archive/*"                                          # what is archived
git switch -c jak2/features/<slug> archive/jak2/features/<slug>     # restore a branch
```

To archive a branch yourself: `git tag -a archive/<branch> -m "Archived" origin/<branch>`,
`git push origin archive/<branch>`, then `git push origin --delete <branch>`.

## 4. Where things live

| Path | What | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Agent instructions; `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` | `master-dev`, inherited by every mod |
| `.agents/skills/` | The knowledge base | Submodule of `opengoal-modding-kb` |
| `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/` | Claude Code permissions and hooks | `master-dev` |
| `.claude/skills/` | Links to `.agents/skills/*` made by `task ai-link`, not versioned | Local |
| `.gemini/settings.json` | Makes Gemini CLI read `AGENTS.md` | `master-dev` |
| `docs/modding/guides/`, `docs/modding/templates/` | Tooling guides and templates | `master-dev`, mirrored in mods |
| `docs/modding/current_mod/` | A mod's own technical notes | Each mod repository |
| `README.md`, `index.json` | Mother: hub README and global catalog. Mod: player README and the mod's own catalog | Each repository |
| `scripts/modding/`, `scripts/ai/`, `Taskfile.yml` | Tooling | `master-dev` |

## 5. AI agents in this layout

- Every repository loads the same `AGENTS.md`: Claude Code through `CLAUDE.md`, Gemini CLI
  through `.gemini/settings.json`, Codex, Copilot and Cursor natively.
- Skills live in `.agents/skills/`, which Gemini CLI, Codex, Copilot and Cursor read natively. A
  Claude Code SessionStart hook refreshes the knowledge base and links each skill into
  `.claude/skills/`.
- Agents may compile (`task compile-check`, `task build-release-game`,
  `task build-release-decomp`) and never launch the game: a PreToolUse hook blocks `gk`,
  `task boot-game*`, `task run-game` and debugger attach.
- An agent works on the folder its session opens: start it in the mod's worktree. With a single
  folder, switch before starting a session and not while an agent is working.
- The archived mod branches predate this configuration; moving one to a repository brings it.

## 6. What runs on its own

| Automatic | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| Upstream into `master`, then `master-dev` | Daily at 10:00 UTC (`sync-upstream.yaml`) |
| Global catalog rebuilt from each mod repository's most advanced release | Daily at 10:30 UTC |
| Lint | On every push, in every repository |
| Knowledge base refreshed, skills linked | At the start of each Claude Code session |

Not automatic, on purpose: syncing mods with `master-dev` (`task modding-sync-all` does it on
demand), releases, the full build check (`build.yml`), and archiving branches.

## 7. Working from a fork

Nothing in the tooling names an account: scripts read the owner from the `origin` remote, and the
mother-only workflows run in any repository named `jak-project`. A fork of the mother therefore
works as is once you:

1. fork it under the name `jak-project`, enable its GitHub Actions, and clone it with
   `--recurse-submodules`;
2. publish your own mods with `task modding-new-mod`, which creates them under your account;
3. fork the knowledge base too if you want to record discoveries, and point `.agents/skills` at
   your fork.

The step-by-step procedure, with what the catalog and the launcher need, is in
[`how_to_create_a_mod.md`](how_to_create_a_mod.md#0-set-up-once).
