## 1. Philosophy & Mental Model

In OpenGOAL, developer commands are unified under [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) (`Taskfile.yml`). Instead of remembering long CMake flags, compiler paths, or Python scripts with complex arguments, `task <command>` provides cross-platform, deterministic shortcuts.

### Why use Task?
1. **Targeted Speed:** Never compile 20 binaries when you only need two (`gk` and `goalc`).
2. **Deterministic Environment:** Task manages environment variables (`.env`, active game selection) automatically.
3. **Reproducible CI/CD:** Modding Python scripts run identically locally and in automated GitHub Actions.

---

## 2. Game & Environment Configuration

| Command | When to use? | Why? | What it does under the hood |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task set-game-jak1` | When starting work on a Jak 1 mod. | Switches compiler target and asset search paths to Jak 1. | Runs `python ./scripts/tasks/update-env.py --game jak1`, updating `./scripts/tasks/.env`. |
| `task set-game-jak2` | When starting work on a Jak 2 mod. | Switches compiler target and asset search paths to Jak 2. | Updates `.env` to `GAME=jak2`. |
| `task set-game-jak3` | When starting work on a Jak 3 mod. | Switches compiler target and asset search paths to Jak 3. | Updates `.env` to `GAME=jak3`. |
| `task settings` | Whenever diagnosing configuration issues. | Displays the currently selected game, build dirs, and tool paths. | Runs `update-env.py --info`. |
| `task set-decomp-ntscv1` | When extracting assets from a Black Label NTSC ISO. | Sets the appropriate decompiler config for asset matching. | Updates `DECOMP_CONFIG` in `.env`. |
| `task set-decomp-pal` | When extracting from a European PAL ISO. | Sets PAL translation and asset mappings. | Updates `DECOMP_CONFIG` to PAL. |

---

## 3. C++ Build & Compilation Tasks

### Generator Configuration
- `task gen-cmake-release`:
  - **When?** Once after cloning the repo, after deleting `build/`, or after CMakeLists changes.
  - **Why?** Configures CMake with Clang and Ninja. Automatically detects and enables `sccache` compiler cache if installed on PATH, accelerating rebuilds by 10×.
- **sccache** (optional, recommended): install it (`scoop install sccache` on Windows, `sudo apt install sccache` or `cargo install sccache` on Linux, `brew install sccache` on macOS), then run `task gen-cmake-release` again, which wires it in when it is on `PATH`. Raise its cache size so several mods fit (`setx SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE 25G` on Windows, `export SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE=25G` elsewhere). `sccache --show-stats` shows the cache hits: a rebuild after switching mods should be almost all hits.
- `task clean-cmake`:
  - **When?** When CMake cache corruption occurs or after major upstream refactors.
  - **Why?** Deletes `build/` and `out/build/` cleanly.

### Compilation Targets (The 3-Layer Rule)
- `task build-release-game`:
  - **When?** Fast iteration when modifying engine C++ (`game/`), OpenGL shaders, or the compiler (`goalc/`).
  - **Why?** Compiles ONLY `gk` and `goalc`. Skips ~18 unneeded binaries (decompiler, LSP, unit tests). Takes seconds instead of 10+ minutes.
- `task build-release-decomp`:
  - **When?** When changing asset extraction logic, glTF model injection (`extra_art_groups_by_dgo`), or collision parsers in `decompiler/`.
  - **Why?** Compiles ONLY the decompiler binary. A decompiler change reaches the game only after `task extract` (or the decompile tasks of §6) runs it again.
- `task build-release`:
  - **When?** First setup or when cutting a full release.
  - **Why?** Builds all ~20 executables across the repository.
- `task build-debug`, `task build-debug-game`, `task build-debug-decomp`: the Debug equivalents, after `task gen-cmake-debug`.

---

## 4. Asset Baking & Game Execution

| Command | When to use? | Why? | What it does under the hood |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task extract` | After installing an ISO or changing decompiler config / injected assets. | Extracts 3D models, textures, animations, and level collision from `./iso_data` into `./decompiler_out`. | Runs `decompiler.exe` with `levels_extract: true`. |
| `task boot-game` | Cold launch testing of your mod. | Launches the game natively in debug mode (`-debug`), loading save slot 1. | Runs `gk.exe -v --game jak[x] -- -boot -fakeiso -debug`. |
| `task boot-game-retail` | Mandatory testing of in-game Mods menu (`mods-menu.gc`). | Reproduces retail boot (`-boot -fakeiso` without debug segment), proving the mod works for players. | Runs `gk.exe` without `-debug`. |
| `task run-game` | Launching runtime in listening mode for the REPL. | Keeps the game window waiting for REPL connection. | Runs `gk.exe -- -fakeiso -debug`. |

---

## 5. REPL & Live Code Iteration

- `task repl`:
  - **When?** During GOAL Lisp coding (`goal_src/**/*.gc`).
  - **Why?** Opens the interactive `goalc` compiler shell connected to the running game.
  - **Inside the REPL:**
    - `(mi)`: Incremental compile — re-reads modified `.gc` files and injects updated functions/states directly into game memory in milliseconds.
    - `(r)`: Restarts the active process or resets the level state.
- `task compile-check`:
  - **When?** To verify that the active game's GOAL code compiles, without a running game.
  - **Why?** Runs the same `(mi)` through `goalc --cmd` and exits, so it never opens a game window. This is the verification step AI agents are allowed to run on their own.

---

## 6. Decompiling

These tasks drive the same `decompiler` binary as `task extract` in §4, but target the code-decompilation and `goal_src/` authoring loop instead of level/asset baking. Most take a `FILE=<object-name>` argument (the bare object name, no extension) to scope the run to a single GOAL object instead of the whole game. They require `task build-release-decomp` (or `build-release`) to have been run first, and the active game/decomp config set via §2.

- `task disasm`
  - **When?** You need raw EE disassembly and per-function metadata for the whole game, without producing GOAL pseudo-code.
  - **Why?** Runs the decompiler with `--config-override '{"disassemble_code": true, "dump_function_metadata": true, "levels_extract": false}'` — disassembly only, no decompilation, no level extraction.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task disasm
    ```

- `task decomp-no-override`
  - **When?** You want the decompiler to run using exactly the flags already baked into `decompiler/config/<game>_config.jsonc`, with no ad-hoc override forcing `decompile_code`/`levels_extract` one way or the other.
  - **Why?** It's the one decompiling task that passes no `--config-override`, useful for reproducing the config file's own committed defaults exactly.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task decomp-no-override
    ```

- `task decomp`
  - **When?** Standard "redecompile the whole game" pass — after editing type hints/casts across many objects in the decompiler config, and you want fresh `.gc` output in `decompiler_out/<game>/` for everything.
  - **Why?** Runs with `{"decompile_code": true, "levels_extract": false}` — full code decompilation, skipping the slower level/texture extraction step.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task decomp
    ```

- `task disasm-file`
  - **When?** Debugging one object's raw disassembly — e.g. tracing why the decompiler mis-detects a function's args, or crashes on it — without disassembling the whole game.
  - **Why?** Same override as `disasm`, plus `"allowed_objects": ["<FILE>"]` to scope it to a single object.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task disasm-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task decomp-file`
  - **When?** The everyday decompiling loop: tweak a type hint or cast for one object in the decompiler config, re-decompile just that object, and inspect the result in `decompiler_out/<game>/`.
  - **Why?** Same override as `decomp`, scoped to a single object via `allowed_objects`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task decomp-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task decomp-clean`
  - **When?** Before a clean full re-decompile or re-extraction, so stale output doesn't pollute a diff or mask a regression.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/tasks/clean-decomp.py --game <game>`, which deletes every `*.gc` and `*.asm` file under `decompiler_out/<game>/`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task decomp-clean
    ```

- `task lint-gsrc-file`
  - **When?** After hand-editing a file that already lives in `goal_src/`, before committing it.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/gsrc/lint-gsrc-file.py`, which scans the file for known decompilation leftovers — unresolved `method-of-type`/`method-of-object` splits, raw `(t9-N ...)` function-pointer calls, missing args, `;; ERROR` markers — and prints them with file/line context. It only reports; it doesn't rewrite anything.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task lint-gsrc-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task update-gsrc`
  - **When?** You've been editing the decompiler config and now have a pile of changed or new `*_REF.gc` files under `test/decompiler/reference/<game>/` that need folding back into `goal_src/`, and don't want to do it file by file.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/gsrc/update-gsrc-via-refs.py`, which finds every changed/untracked `*_REF.gc` via `git status`, re-decompiles the matching object with the current decompiler build, and merges the fresh output into the matching `goal_src/` file.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-gsrc
    ```

- `task update-gsrc-glob`
  - **When?** Same as `update-gsrc`, but scoped to a subset of reference files by pattern instead of relying on git's changed-file list — e.g. re-running after those `_REF.gc` files are already committed.
  - **Why?** Same script, but selects files with `--file_pattern <GLOB>` matched against `test/decompiler/reference/<game>/` instead of git status.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-gsrc-glob GLOB="vehicle-turret*"
    ```

- `task update-gsrc-file`
  - **When?** The single-file version of the port-and-clean loop: you're actively working on one object and want the decompiler's latest output folded into its `goal_src/` file — with your comments and `;; decomp deviation` blocks preserved — then linted, in one command.
  - **Why?** Chains three steps: `decomp-file FILE=<obj>` (re-decompile) → `scripts/gsrc/update-from-decomp.py` (merges the fresh decompilation into the existing `goal_src/` file using heuristics that try to keep 100% of comments and decomp-deviation blocks in their original spot) → `lint-gsrc-file` (reports any leftovers).
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-gsrc-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task copy-common-naming`
  - **When?** Syncing variable/function naming decisions for one shared "common" object across game versions.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/gsrc/copy-common-naming.py --file <FILE> --decompiler <path-to-decompiler>`, then reformats the touched `.jsonc` configs with `format-json`.
  - > [!IMPORTANT]
  - > This task currently points at `scripts/gsrc/copy-common-naming.py`, which no longer exists in the repo (removed during a decomp cleanup pass). It will fail immediately with a Python "file not found" error until the script is restored or the task is repointed.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task copy-common-naming FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task copy-common-naming-from-refs`
  - **When?** Bulk-syncing naming across all common objects at once, instead of one file at a time.
  - **Why?** Same script as `copy-common-naming`, called with `--update-names-from-refs` instead of `--file`, then `format-json`.
  - > [!IMPORTANT]
  - > Same missing-script issue as `copy-common-naming` above — currently fails until `scripts/gsrc/copy-common-naming.py` is restored.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task copy-common-naming-from-refs
    ```

## 7. Asset Ripping

These are `task extract` variants for pulling assets out in formats meant for use *outside* the engine (external 3D tools, standalone PNGs, playable audio), rather than the engine's internal `.fr3`/texture-page formats. Same prerequisites as `task extract` in §4: a populated `./iso_data`, and the decompiler built.

| Command | When to use? | Why? | What it does under the hood |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task rip-textures` | Building a texture pack, or previewing every texture the game uses outside the engine. | Extracts levels and additionally dumps every texture as a standalone `.png`. | Runs the decompiler with `{"levels_extract": true, "save_texture_pngs": true}`; PNGs land under `decompiler_out/<game>/textures/`. |
| `task rip-levels` | Bringing level geometry into an external 3D tool (e.g. Blender) instead of the engine's internal format. | Extracts levels and additionally exports each one as glTF. | Runs the decompiler with `{"levels_extract": true, "rip_levels": true}`; writes `<level>-background.glb` plus foreground art group glTFs under `decompiler_out/<game>/levels/`. |
| `task rip-collision` | Inspecting or reusing a level's collision mesh outside the engine. | Extracts levels and additionally dumps collision as `.obj`. | Runs the decompiler with `{"levels_extract": true, "extract_collision": true, "rip_collision": true}`; writes `collide-<name>.obj` under `decompiler_out/<game>/collision/`. |
| `task rip-audio` | Pulling voice lines or streamed SFX out of the game's audio files. | Extracts levels and additionally rips streamed audio. | Runs the decompiler with `{"levels_extract": true, "rip_streamed_audio": true}`; output lands under `decompiler_out/<game>/audio/voice_lines/` and `decompiler_out/<game>/audio/sfx/`. |

---

## 8. Tools

Standalone utilities and CI-style checks wrapped as tasks. Most need `task build-release` (or the specific lighter target that produces the binary in question) run first.

- `task analyze-ee-memory FILE=<path-to-.p2s>`
  - **When?** You have a PCSX2 savestate and want to search its Emotion Engine RAM dump for a known value or pattern — typically while reverse-engineering an in-memory struct.
  - **Why?** Unzips the savestate (`.p2s` files are zip archives) into `savestate_out/`, then runs `memory_dump_tool` against the extracted `eeMemory.bin`, writing results to `ee-analysis.log`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task analyze-ee-memory FILE=savestates/traffic-manager.p2s
    ```

- `task watch-pcsx2`
  - **When?** Iterating against live memory in PCSX2 and you want every savestate you take analyzed automatically, instead of running `analyze-ee-memory` by hand each time.
  - **Why?** Watches `SAVESTATE_DIR` (defaults to the current directory) with `watchmedo` and runs `task analyze-ee-memory FILE=<new file>` whenever a `.p2s` file appears.
  - > [!NOTE]
  - > Needs the `watchdog` package with its CLI extra: `pip install -U "watchdog[watchmedo]"`. Without it, `watchmedo` isn't on PATH and the task fails immediately.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task watch-pcsx2 SAVESTATE_DIR="C:/Users/me/Documents/PCSX2/sstates"
    ```

- `task type-search`
  - **When?** You know a struct has, say, two `int16` fields at specific byte offsets and want to search every known type for a matching field layout, to help identify an unknown type.
  - **Why?** Runs `type_searcher` against every known type looking for that field layout (an array of `{type, offset}` pairs passed via `--fields`), writing matches to `search-results.json`. As the task's own description says, this is "just an example to show it running" — the `--fields` payload is hardcoded in `Taskfile.yml` itself (`int16` at offsets 2 and 4); a real search means editing that JSON in the task, or invoking `type_searcher` directly with your own `--fields`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task type-search
    ```

- `task update-treesitter`
  - **When?** After changing the OpenGOAL grammar in the separate `tree-sitter-opengoal` repo, and you want the parser tables used by editor tooling in this repo refreshed.
  - **Why?** Runs `yarn gen` in `../tree-sitter-opengoal`, then copies its generated `src/` and `grammar.js` into `third-party/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-opengoal` here.
  - > [!IMPORTANT]
  - > Requires a sibling checkout of `tree-sitter-opengoal` at `../tree-sitter-opengoal` (next to this repo's folder, not inside it), with `yarn` installed. Fails immediately otherwise.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-treesitter
    ```

- `task fix-translations`
  - **When?** After editing any in-game text/subtitle string tables, before committing.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/ci/lint-autoglottonyms.py --fix` (makes sure each language's name for itself, e.g. "English"/"français", is never accidentally translated) then `scripts/ci/lint-characters.py --fix` (strips or replaces characters outside the game's supported glyph set), both in fix mode.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task fix-translations
    ```

- `task lint`
  - **When?** Before committing changes under `goal_src/`, or to see why CI's lint step failed.
  - **Why?** Runs `scripts/ci/lint-trailing-whitespace.py` (no `--fix`) over every `.gc`/`.gs`/`.gd` file in `goal_src/`; lists offending files and exits non-zero instead of modifying anything. Use `task format` if you want it fixed instead of just reported.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task lint
    ```

- `task run-gpu-test`
  - **When?** Verifying the runtime's OpenGL support on a machine before chasing a graphics bug, or for a headless GPU sanity check.
  - **Why?** Runs `gk -v --gpu-test opengl --gpu-test-out-path ./gpu-test.json` — the game's built-in self-test, without booting into a save.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task run-gpu-test
    ```

---

## 9. Tests

These wrap the `goalc-test` and `offline-test` binaries. `unit-tests` uses the Debug build (`task build`); everything else uses the Release build (`task build-release`). The `offline-test`-based tasks additionally decompile straight from the ISO data and compare it against the checked-in `test/decompiler/reference/<game>/*_REF.gc` files.

- `task unit-tests`
  - **When?** Running the Debug-build GOAL compiler/runtime unit test suite, e.g. after touching `goalc/` internals.
  - **Why?** Runs `goalc-test` (Debug build) with whatever raw gtest flags you pass via `TEST_FILTER` — nothing is filtered by default.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task unit-tests TEST_FILTER='--gtest_filter="*TypeSystem*"'
    ```

- `task offline-tests`
  - **When?** Running the full decompiler-output-vs-reference regression suite for the active `GAME`. This is what CI (Jenkins) runs.
  - **Why?** Runs `offline-test --iso_data_path ./iso_data/<game> --game <game> --fail-on-cmp`, which decompiles every object straight from the ISO data and fails if the output doesn't match the checked-in `_REF.gc` files.
  - > [!IMPORTANT]
  - > Needs the game's raw files extracted at `./iso_data/<game>/` — the same location `task extract` reads from. Without it, the tests can't even start.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task offline-tests
    ```

- `task offline-test-file`
  - **When?** Checking whether a single object's decompilation still matches its reference file, without running the whole suite.
  - **Why?** Same as `offline-tests`, scoped to one object via `--file`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task offline-test-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task offline-tests-fast`
  - **When?** Running the full offline suite locally, trading a clean pass/fail summary for parallelism and dumped output.
  - **Why?** Same as `offline-tests`, plus `--pretty-print --num_threads 8 --dump_current_output` (multi-threaded, and writes each failing object's actual output to `./failures/` for inspection).
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task offline-tests-fast
    ```

- `task update-ref-tests`
  - **When?** You intentionally changed decompiler output for many objects (config or decompiler code change) and want to "bless" the new output as the new reference, in bulk.
  - **Why?** Clears `./failures/`, runs the offline suite tolerating failures (to populate `./failures/` with current output), copies those into `test/decompiler/reference/<game>/` via `scripts/update_decomp_reference.py`, then re-runs `offline-tests-fast` to confirm everything now passes.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-ref-tests
    ```

- `task update-ref-file`
  - **When?** Same as `update-ref-tests`, but for a single object.
  - **Why?** Same pipeline, scoped to `--file <FILE>`, finishing with `offline-test-file` instead of the full suite.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task update-ref-file FILE=vehicle-turret
    ```

- `task type-test`
  - **When?** Verifying GOAL type definitions (sizes, field offsets, method layouts) are internally consistent for the active game.
  - **Why?** Runs the Release `goalc-test` binary filtered to `*<TYPE_CONSISTENCY_TEST_FILTER>*` (set per-game by `update-env.py`, e.g. `Jak1TypeConsistency`) with `--gtest_break_on_failure`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task type-test
    ```

- `task tests-filtered`
  - **When?** Running a specific subset of the Release `goalc-test` suite by name — e.g. re-running just the test you're fixing.
  - **Why?** Runs `goalc-test --gtest_filter="*<FILTER>*" --gtest_break_on_failure`.
  - *Example:*
    ```bash
    task tests-filtered FILTER=TrafficManager
    ```

## 10. Modding Automation Scripts (`scripts/modding/`)

These tasks wrap specialized Python automation scripts located in `scripts/modding/` and `scripts/ai/`. You can pass parameters to any script after `--` (e.g. `task modding-new-mod -- --new jak2/my-mod --youtube https://youtu.be/...`).

---

### 1. `task modding-new-mod [-- options]`
- **Script:** [`create_mod_repo.py`](../../../scripts/modding/create_mod_repo.py)
- **When?** Starting a new mod (run it without arguments: it asks for the game, the mod name, one sentence for players, the visibility, then confirms), or moving a mod that still lives on a branch of this repository into its own repository.
- **Why?** Every mod lives in its own GitHub repository, `<owner>/<game>-mod-<slug>`, where the slug is the mod's launcher catalog key kept verbatim. In this clone that repository is the remote `<name>` and the local branch `mods/<name>` (see `task modding-switch`). Nothing is deleted: the source branch and `mods/<name>` both stay. Two steps, so a failed run can simply be re-run:
  1. **Prepare (local):** builds `mods/<name>` in a temporary worktree in the system temp folder (outside your editor's workspace): the mod merged with the local `master-dev` under the mod-repository rules, plus one commit with the repository-specific changes (README from the template or a "moved from" note, catalog name and `websiteUrl`). Re-running it merges newer `master-dev` commits into a prepared branch.
  2. **Publish:** creates the public repository with the `opengoal-mod` topic (how the global catalog finds it), pushes `mods/<name>` as its `main`, and sets `mods/<name>` to track and push to it. Needs `gh`, authenticated with `gh auth login`.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | *(none)* | | Ask for everything interactively. |
  | `--new <game>/<slug>` | String | Start a new mod from `master-dev` without questions, e.g. `jak2/my-mod`. |
  | `--from-branch <branch>...` | One or more strings | Move mod branches (`jak[1-3]/<type>/<slug>`, or their archive tags `archive/<branch>`) into their own repositories. |
  | `--description "<text>"` | String *(optional)* | One-line description (README overview of a new mod, and the repository description). |
  | `--youtube <url>` | String *(optional)* | Demo video URL embedded in a new mod's README. |
  | `--private` | Flag *(optional)* | Create private repositories; they stay out of the launcher catalog until made public. |
  | `--prepare-only` | Flag *(optional)* | Build the local branches and publish nothing. |
  | `--redo` | Flag *(optional)* | Rebuild prepared branches that were never published. |

*Example:*
```bash
task modding-new-mod
task modding-new-mod -- --new jak2/traffic-overhaul --description "Denser, smarter Haven City traffic." --private
```

---

### 2. `task modding-switch -- <target>`
- **Script:** [`switch_mod.py`](../../../scripts/modding/switch_mod.py)
- **When?** Moving this working directory to another mod or back to `master-dev`.
- **Why?** Mod repositories share their history with this repository, so one clone holds them all and the extracted game data and build cache stay shared. A mod repository `<name>` becomes the remote `<name>` and the local branch `mods/<name>`, created and fetched on first use. The task also parks the knowledge-base submodule before switching to an old mod branch restored from its archive tag (those carry a plain copy of the skills at `.agents/skills`), then refreshes the knowledge base and the skill links. Those branches predate the task: to leave one, run `git switch master-dev`, then `task kb-update`. An archived branch named as the target gets the command that restores it.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `<target>` | Positional | A mod repository name (`jak2-mod-my-mod`), `master-dev`, or a branch name. |
  | `--list` | Flag *(optional)* | List the mod repositories (here and on GitHub), and the old mod branches if any are left. |

*Example:*
```bash
task modding-switch -- jak2-mod-my-mod
```

---

### 3. `task modding-sync-branch -- [options]`
- **Script:** [`sync_branch_with_master_dev.py`](../../../scripts/modding/sync_branch_with_master_dev.py)
- **When?** Whenever your mod needs the latest modding base. On `mods/<name>` it pushes to the mod repository's `main`; on a restored mod branch, to that branch.
- **Why?** Merges `master-dev` into the current mod while preserving its root `README.md` and `index.json`, taking the shared agent configuration and docs from `master-dev`, and dropping the workflows and files that only belong to the mother repository.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `--remote <name>` | String (`origin` here, `mother` in a standalone mod clone) | Remote holding `master-dev`; `mother` is added automatically on first use. |
  | `--branch <name>` | String (`current branch`) | Target branch to synchronize. |
  | `--rebase` | Flag *(optional)* | Uses `git rebase` instead of `git merge` (rewrites local commit history; use only on unpushed local commits). |
  | `--push` | Flag *(optional)* | Pushes the synchronized branch to its upstream (`mods/<name>` to the mod repository's `main`) if the merge succeeds cleanly. |
  | `--source <branch>` | String (`master-dev`) | Source branch to merge from. |
  | `--local-source` | Flag *(optional)* | Merge the local source branch without fetching (used by `create_mod_repo.py`). |
  | `--mod-repo` | Flag *(optional)* | Apply the mod-repository rules; automatic on `mods/*` branches and with the `mother` remote. |

*Example (on `mods/<name>`):*
```bash
task modding-sync-branch -- --push
```

---

### 4. `task modding-sync-all -- [options]`
- **Script:** [`sync_all_mods.py`](../../../scripts/modding/sync_all_mods.py)
- **When?** After a change on `master-dev` that every mod should get (an engine patch, the Mods menu framework, tooling, shared docs, the knowledge-base pointer).
- **Why?** Runs `task modding-sync-branch -- --push` for every mod repository at once, in temporary worktrees in the system temp folder, so your working directory, its branch and its uncommitted changes are never touched. The mod repositories are the local `mods/*` branches plus, when `gh` is installed, the account's repositories with the `opengoal-mod` topic. For each one it fetches it, merges `origin/master-dev` under the mod-repository rules and pushes to its `main`. It skips a mod already up to date, one whose `mods/<name>` holds commits that are not pushed, and the one checked out here (sync that one with `task modding-sync-branch -- --push`). A real conflict leaves that mod untouched, nothing pushed, and the summary names the files; the task then exits with an error.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `<name>...` | Positional *(optional)* | Only these mod repositories (default: all of them). |
  | `--dry-run` | Flag *(optional)* | Report what each mod needs; merge and push nothing. |

*Example:*
```bash
task modding-sync-all -- --dry-run
task modding-sync-all
```

---

### 5. `task kb-update` and `task ai-link`
- **Scripts:** [`kb_sync.py`](../../../scripts/ai/kb_sync.py), [`link_skills.py`](../../../scripts/ai/link_skills.py)
- **When?** Rarely by hand: the Claude Code SessionStart hook runs both at the start of every session.
- **Why?** `.agents/skills/` is the knowledge-base submodule (`opengoal-modding-kb`, URL in `.gitmodules`). `kb-update` initialises it, puts it on `main` and fast-forwards it, without ever discarding local commits or edits, then links each skill into `.claude/skills/`, the only folder Claude Code reads. `ai-link` does the linking alone. To record a discovery in the knowledge base, follow the `kb` skill.

*Example:*
```bash
task kb-update
```

---

### 6. `task modding-sync-catalog -- [options]`
- **Script:** [`sync_global_catalog.py`](../../../scripts/modding/sync_global_catalog.py)
- **When?** On `master-dev` to refresh and rebuild the unified root `index.json` catalog containing all published mods and versions.
- **Why?** Queries the GitHub Releases of this repository and of every mod repository (same owner, `opengoal-mod` topic), parses the catalog attached to each release, dedupes versions, takes each mod repository's own `index.json` as the source of its name, description and website, and writes the consolidated Launcher v1 schema file.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `--repo <owner/repo>` | String (`auto-detect`) | Target GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format. |
  | `--output <path>` | Path (`<repo_root>/index.json`) | Output path for the consolidated catalog file. |
  | `--offline` | Flag *(optional)* | Gathers releases strictly from local git release tags (`*-v*.*.*`) without calling GitHub REST API. |
  | `--source-name "<name>"` | String (`<Owner> OpenGOAL Mods Hub`) | Catalog display title shown in the OpenGOAL Launcher UI. |
  | `--dry-run` | Flag *(optional)* | Analyzes releases and prints summary statistics to terminal without modifying `index.json`. |

*Example:*
```bash
task modding-sync-catalog -- --offline
```

---

### 7. Per-Mod Catalog Tool: `update_mod_catalog.py`
- **When?** During release creation (`release.yml` calls it).
- **Why?** Generates and maintains an individual mod's `index.json` catalog.

---

### 8. `task modding-package-texture-pack` (Alias: `task modding-register-texture-pack`) `-- [options]`
- **Script:** [`package_texture_pack.py`](../../../scripts/modding/package_texture_pack.py)
- **When?** When registering a standalone texture pack into `index.json` after exporting it via the OpenGOAL Texture Pack Generator GUI (or when creating one via CLI with `--from-source`). On `mods/<name>`, its URLs point at the mod repository and its release. The OpenGOAL Launcher does not link a texture pack to a mod: its mod-source schema has no such field, it applies texture packs to the base game only, from a `.zip` the player adds in its Texture Packs screen, and its texture support for installed mods is not finished (checked on its `main` branch, 2026-10-02).
- **Why?** Recovers launcher-compliant `.zip` archives from `docs/modding/current_mod/texture_packs/` (generated by the GUI tool), inspects their internal `metadata.json`, computes SHA256 checksums, and automatically registers or updates the texture pack in `index.json` under `"texturePacks"`. Also supports building directly from raw PNG textures in `custom_assets/<game>/texture_replacements/` when run with `--from-source`.
- **CLI Parameters (`-- <args>`):**
  | Parameter | Type / Default | Description |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `--dir <path>` | Path (`docs/modding/current_mod/texture_packs/`) | Directory to scan for `.zip` texture archives. |
  | `--zip <path>` | Path *(optional)* | Specific texture pack `.zip` file to register directly. |
  | `--no-index` | Flag *(optional)* | Inspects archive and computes SHA256 checksums without writing into `index.json`. |
  | `--release-url <url>` | String *(optional)* | Custom base URL where the texture pack `.zip` is hosted for downloads. |
  | `--game <id>` | Choice (`jak1|jak2|jak3|jakx`) | Target game identifier. |
  | `--from-source` | Flag *(optional)* | Compiles a new `.zip` archive directly from raw PNG files in `custom_assets/<game>/texture_replacements/`. |
  | `--slug <slug>` | String *(with `--from-source`)* | Unique identifier slug for the pack. |
  | `--display-name "<name>"` | String *(with `--from-source`)* | Human-readable display title in Launcher. |
  | `--description "<text>"` | String *(with `--from-source`)* | Detailed texture pack description. |
  | `--author "<name>"` | String *(with `--from-source`)* | Author or creator name. |
  | `--version <semver>` | String (`1.0.0`) | Semantic version string. |
  | `--tags <tag...>` | List *(with `--from-source`)* | Keywords/tags for filtering in Launcher. |
  | `--cover <path>` | Path *(with `--from-source`)* | Cover thumbnail image (`cover.png`). |
  | `--output <path>` | Path *(with `--from-source`)* | Destination `.zip` archive file path. |

*Example:*
```bash
# Register GUI-exported zip into index.json:
task modding-package-texture-pack

# Package directly from raw PNG assets:
task modding-package-texture-pack -- --from-source --game jak2 --slug blue-kg-textures --display-name "Blue KG Textures"
```

## 11. Common Developer Workflows

### Scenario A: Fast LISP Gameplay Modding
1. `task set-game-jak2`
2. `task run-game` (in terminal 1)
3. `task repl` (in terminal 2)
4. Edit `.gc` files in `goal_src/jak2/`
5. In REPL: `(mi)` to hot reload instantly.

### Scenario B: Testing In-Game Mods Menu (Retail Boot)
1. Close REPL and game.
2. `task boot-game-retail`
3. Press **L3 + SELECT** on gamepad to ensure menu opens and toggle functions properly.

### Scenario C: Packaging & Distributing a Custom Texture Pack
1. Place or extract textures in `custom_assets/<game>/texture_replacements/`.
2. Open the [OpenGOAL Texture Pack Generator](https://github.com/whozghiar/open-goal-texture-pack-generator) desktop tool (separate repository).
3. Select textures, set name, version, author, and description, then export the `.zip` archive into `docs/modding/current_mod/texture_packs/`.
4. Register the pack into `index.json`: `task modding-package-texture-pack`.
5. When publishing, upload the `.zip` archive as a GitHub Release asset (or trigger `release.yml` which automatically packages it).

### Scenario D: Bringing the Latest Modding Base into the Mods
1. Every mod at once: `task modding-sync-all` (try `-- --dry-run` first). Only the current mod: switch to it (`task modding-switch -- <name>`), then `task modding-sync-branch -- --push`.
2. If a mod reports a conflict, switch to it, run `task modding-sync-branch`, resolve the reported files, commit and push.
3. Test with cold boot: `task boot-game-retail`.
