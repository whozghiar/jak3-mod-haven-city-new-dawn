## 2. Key Entry Points

### Modding & AI-Assisted Development
- **[Lisp Wiki (`.agents/skills/goal-lisp/wiki/`)](../.agents/skills/goal-lisp/wiki/index.md)**: verified Lisp instructions in the knowledge-base submodule — patterns and engine model shared by the three games in `common.md`, each game's specifics in `jak1.md`, `jak2.md` and `jak3.md`.
- **[How to Create a Mod](modding/guides/how_to_create_a_mod.md)**: the step-by-step procedure, from your own fork and the first build to the release, with the resources to use, the AI-agent workflow and how to update the knowledge base.
- **[Repository Workflow Guide](modding/guides/repository_workflow.md)**: how the mother repository, the mod repositories and the knowledge base fit together, what switching between them in one working directory implies, and the day-to-day commands (switch, sync, release, record knowledge).
- **[AI Agent & Developer Guide (`AGENTS.md`)](../AGENTS.md)**: what every AI agent follows: compile but never launch the game, golden rules for mods, knowledge base, language and documentation standards, commands and Git.
- **[GitHub Actions Workflows Guide](modding/guides/github_workflows.md)**: detailed pedagogical guide to repository CI/CD, upstream synchronization, releases, and issue triaging.
- **[Task Commands & Modding Scripts Reference](modding/guides/task_scripts_reference.md)**: pedagogical reference for all Taskfile commands and `scripts/modding/*.py` automations.
- **[Modular Skills (`.agents/skills/`)](../.agents/skills/)**: high-density engineering skills loaded on demand:
  - [`goal-lisp`](../.agents/skills/goal-lisp/SKILL.md): GOAL syntax, state machines, types & macros.
  - [`engine-internals`](../.agents/skills/engine-internals/SKILL.md): C++ runtime, heaps & REPL workflow.
  - [`custom-actors-levels`](../.agents/skills/custom-actors-levels/SKILL.md): 3D models, Blender `.glb` exports, armatures & levels.
  - [`texture-modding`](../.agents/skills/texture-modding/SKILL.md): custom texture injection & replacement.
  - [`documentalist`](../.agents/skills/documentalist/SKILL.md): documentation standards enforcement.
  - [`kb`](../.agents/skills/kb/SKILL.md): recording a verified discovery in the knowledge base.

## 4. Engine Architecture & Historical Notes

- **[Project Overview (`docs/project-overview.md`)](project-overview.md)**: Upstream architecture and component roles.
- **[Progress Notes (`docs/progress-notes/`)](progress-notes/)**: Decompilation notes, bone systems, joint decompression, and VU assembly documentation.
